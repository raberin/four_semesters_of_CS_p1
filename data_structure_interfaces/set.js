/*

A set allows allows at least four things: add, remove, contains, and toList. 
The basic idea is that you can add items to a set and then later check if they're there. 
You can also request later a list of those items in the set (though with no guaranteed order; sets have no notion of order.) 
They're also useful for deduplication since you can only add something to a set once.

Most important:
  1. No order
  2. All unique, can't duplicate
